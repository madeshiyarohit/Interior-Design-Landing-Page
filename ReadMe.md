## Project Name : **Interior Design Homepage!**

In this project i have created a Interior Design Homepage from scratch. And i have learnt a lot of things like how to use flex and how css makes life easier , we can manipulate the things in Html with the help of CSS without touching HTML file in terms of positing and direction not in terms of DOM manipulationðŸ˜… and mainly in this project i learnt about position absolute and relative.
